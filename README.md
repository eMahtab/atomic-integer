# AtomicInteger

The java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger class in Java, is used for handling integer values in a way that is **safe for concurrent access by multiple threads** without requiring explicit synchronization (such as synchronized blocks).

**Key Uses of AtomicInteger in Java**
**Atomic Operations:** AtomicInteger provides atomic operations like get(), set(), incrementAndGet(), decrementAndGet(), addAndGet(), and compareAndSet(). These methods ensure that the entire operation is performed atomically, which is crucial in multi-threaded applications.

**Counters in Concurrency:** AtomicInteger is often used as a counter shared among multiple threads. For instance, if multiple threads need to increment a shared counter, AtomicInteger provides thread-safe increments via incrementAndGet() and getAndIncrement() without requiring synchronized methods.

**Efficient Thread-Safe Updates:** By using atomic operations, AtomicInteger avoids the need for explicit synchronization (like using synchronized or Lock). This reduces overhead and increases performance when compared to traditional synchronization, especially in high-concurrency scenarios.
